I created a basic starter game based off the game show "Who wants to be a millionaire?" for my python project.

I went with this because it seemed fun to do while at the same time it felt like a good way to utilize a lot of the crucial parts that were taught throughout the course.

The game only has a total of 15 questions and shows the value of each question just like the game show.
